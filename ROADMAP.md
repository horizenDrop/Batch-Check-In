# Batch Check-In Roadmap

## Current Scope
- One-page app with 3 buttons: `1`, `10`, `100`.
- One signature per selected batch.
- Server verifies signature and applies selected check-in count.

## Next
1. Bind real Base/Farcaster user identity to `playerId`.
2. Add replay protection analytics and signature audit trail.
3. Add optional relayer mode (gasless UX) if needed.
